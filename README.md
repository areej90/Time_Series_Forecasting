# Time Series Forecasting

## Overview
Time series forecasting involves predicting future observations based on previously observed data points. 
In these projects, we explore various time series forecasting techniques to accurately predict future trends in different datasets.

The main objective of time series forecasting is to model patterns such as seasonality, trends, and cyclic behavior to improve predictive accuracy. These techniques are widely used across industries, including finance, healthcare, energy, and traffic systems. By leveraging historical data, we can make informed decisions and predictions about future events.
